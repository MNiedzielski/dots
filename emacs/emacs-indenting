Do you ever have to work on someone's code that is indented at level 4 instead
of 8, and uses the mess of tabs and 4 spaces that vi gives when you hit ^t?

Usually, I just pipe the whole thing through 'cb'.

In the case of the code that I am working on now, that might not be appropriate.
[I don't really own it.] So, I add the following to the bottom of every file
that I have to edit:

/*
 * Emacs formatting control info.
 *
 * Local Variables:
 * c-indent-level: 4
 * c-brace-offset: -4
 * c-label-offset: -4
 * c-argdecl-indent: 0
 * c-continued-statement-offset: 4
 * eval: ( define-key c-mode-map "\177" 'backward-delete-char-untabify )
 * End:
 */

Emacs (aka "God's Editor") reads the local variables section, and sets up my
C style indentation to be compatible with the braindead vi system.

I still need to look at the mess, but at least I don't have to fight against
emacs to write code in context.

M-

ps. A local variables section has to be withing 3000 bytes of the *end* of
    a file for emacs to consider using it.
