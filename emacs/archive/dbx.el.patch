In the dbx.el file kindly provided by Robert Lupton, if you change the
variable dbx-break-point to 

	(defvar dbx-break-point
	  "in .* at line \\([0-9]*\\) in file \"\\([^\"]*\\)\""
	  "Regexp of pattern that dbx writes at break point.")

Then dbx-where will work for segmentation violations as well as for break
points.

Now for the question:
	dbx-where doesn't print out the overlay-arrow-string.
	It looks like the code is trying to--but it doesn't succeed.

What's wrong?
